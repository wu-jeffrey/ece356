1. Rewrote the query to first find the games in the 2019-2020 season,
2. The Gameplays within that set of that season's games (i.e. the same GameIDs) that were also goals for the Leafs are found.
3. From that set of `LeafsGoals`, the first Leaf goal is found.
4. Then playerInfo with the ID matching the `GamePlayPlayer` who was the scorer for the first Leafs goal is found.

No indexes were added, since the index on `Game (season)` allows the games from the '20192020' season to be found via index. The index on `GamePlays (playType)` allows Goals to be found quickly.
This query approach entirely avoids tablescans, except for on `TeamInfo`, but as established in task 2, the TeamInfo is currently very small and adding an index would be unecessary.
